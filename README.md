# Retail-Consumer-Analytics-System

## Abstract
AI technologies have been on the rise and been applied to various commercial
domains. With recent advancements in video processing technology, we can now
record subtle human behavior in a retail shop setting, which is crucial for business
management. Customer behavior, when combined with specific demographic
data, provides considerably more relevant business intelligence insights to the
retail industry. It is key area for any retail scenario as shopping experience plays
a vital role in ensuring the success of the company in the context of retail. Besides,
it also helps predict which time of the day, a particular store is crowded,
composition of male/female population visiting the store, predicting the
preference of the customers and subsequently placing advertisements. In our
work, we would be working on keeping track of real-time footfall analysis,
demographic analysis on the basis of customer age groups and gender detection,
traffic detection in particular sections of the shop and motion heatmaps to
highlight the areas with the most customer traffic activity (i.e., hot zones). At the
end of the work, the results generated suggested that the proposed system could
be effectively employed in order to effectively support the analysis of customer
experience in the context of retail.

## Motivation
The main objective of this work is to support the retailers in devising effective
strategies by supporting their decisions with the required insights or data. Video
analytics provides technical solutions to queries like "How many people visited
my store today/this week/this month?" or "How many customers exhibited
interest in the item on sale?". Information offers retailers with useful insights that
allows them to enhance merchandising/marketing and improve the consumer
experience, resulting in increased profitability. Footfall analysis is a crucial
metric for retailers because it enables them to compute the store conversion rate
(i.e., the percentage of visitors converted to buyers). The conversion rate is an
important metric for retailers because it indicates how well a store is functioning.
By having knowledge on hot zones, Store managers can optimize the layout of
their stores for better product placement. This information can also be used to
assess or improve the performance of sales or advertising displays.

## Modules 

### Footfall Counter
We'll be tracking people's footfall at a retail store in this module. It would offer
detailed statistics on the number of persons seen at various time intervals. Many
shops are missing critical data points such as precise counts of consumer foot
traffic at any one time and knowing how customers move across a store. These
kinds of data may be used to improve not only product placement in stores, but
also personnel levels and even safety. Retailers may also acquire the peak hours
of consumer visits in the shop using this data. These data may then be used to
augment store inventory planning, product placement strategy, better evaluate
personnel needs, and even guarantee that the number of consumers in the shop
does not exceed the legal limit. These insights may also be used to examine
regular travel patterns, fine-tune staffing to account for peaks and troughs in foot
traffic, and learn how external variables like as holidays and weather affect foot
traffic.

### Customer Density Heatmap
The heat maps depict the business, establishment, or public location where the
most people have passed. It is used to examine consumer traffic patterns in a retail
establishment. It enables us to identify the parts of the shop where our consumers
pass, pause, and pay closer attention, as well as the so-called "dead zones of the
store," or regions where customers do not normally pass. In the form of a colour
density heatmap, it shows where the most traffic is focused in the business. The
software creates a heat map using these data, with the red tones indicating the
areas with the most traffic and high consumer attention, the orange areas a
medium-high attention, the green areas a medium-low attention, the areas blue
low attention, and the unpainted areas indicating the dead zones, where
consumers practically do not pass. Retailers may use these figures to better
understand how to optimise product positioning and the efficacy of promotional
displays.

### Gender Demographic Analysis
In this module, we will examine the demographic information of people in a retail
store. Because customer demographics primarily dictate their preferences,
identifying and utilizing customer gender information in sales forecasting may
maximize retail sales. We would draw a box around the people and indicate their
gender. This would aid in the promotion of gender-based marketing. Gender
marketing can be successful if individuality and diversity are considered, which
this module will do so by collecting gender information about purchased
products.

### Traffic Counting System
In this module, we would count the number of people in a retail store in a specific
section at a specific time. It would provide detailed analytics on the number of
people visible at various time intervals in various sections. Using this
information, retailers can determine the peak hours for customer visits to a
specific section. It will not only assist owners in product management in various
sections, but it will also assist them in better advertising different products. It
would also provide information on the sales of various products at different times
of day, which would aid in the better management of products with a short shelf
life.
